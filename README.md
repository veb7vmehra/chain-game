# The BlockChain Game

## What is Blockchain
**Blockchain** is the tool of future’s exchange of **Information** & **Money**.
With no one having control over the universal ledger, blockchain comes out to be the most trustable and free of any dominant centralised organisation like in fiat currencies and other information sharing platforms.

##Problem and Solution
**Blockchain** is the technology of tomorrow, though it’s popularity after Bitcoin has seen a substantial rise, still **most of the people don’t know what a blockchain is** and how it works.
---
We came up with a solution, New and effective, **The BlockChain Game**. It is a 5v5 character based multiplayer 2D top down game. The game focuses on aspects like mining and rewards, universal ledger, value of the currencies, e.t.c. 
With the final goal being to make most blocks in the blockchain.

##TYPES OF CHARACTERS

### 1. ATTACKERS
Attacker’s job is generally to collect the data bits and CPU power from the field.  

### 2.  DEFENDERS
Defender’s job is generally to protect the private key from the enemy’s hacker or attacker.

### 3. HACKER
Hacker’s job is generally to lurk and copy the private key of enemy’s last block hence trying to corrupt the whole blockchain.

### 4. MANAGER (one per team)
Manager is the brain of a team, manager can send fake bits as a trap, can deploy a bot to protect private key from being stolen, can backup a blockchain in case of corrupt, and can can swap his roles with others.
 * **BOT
 When a bot is deployed, it prevents the enemies hacker to steal the private key of a block. Can be used twice in a match with a cooldown of 2 minutes.
 
* **FAKE BIT
Fake bits produces a fake data bit with known private key by a manager which enemy’s attacker might confuse with normal data bit and that will waste the enemies time and might even corrupt their blockchain.

* **BACKUP
It’s manager’s to regularly backup the blockchain, so that incase of a breach team may not lose many blocks and restore back to the last backed up ledger.
